 * — can't do that in the UI now — we could have x1 x2 y1 y2 and only require 3
 * values which would determine the direction."
 *
 * The form used to offer X1, Y1, X2 and write y2 = y1 behind the reader's back,
 * so every position it could make ran stage-left to stage-right. A pipe up and
 * down the deck could be drawn by hand-editing the JSON and no other way — and
 * the rest of the tool already understood one: positions.axis() calls it
 * `longitudinal` and numbers it from downstage, which is Jerry's own convention.
 *
 * ⭐ WHICH VALUE IS MISSING IS THE ANSWER. Leaving one blank says the position
 * does not move in that direction:
 *
 *   x2 blank   the run is UP AND DOWNSTAGE — x does not change
 *   y2 blank   the run is ACROSS — y does not change
 *   both blank a POINT, which is what a boom is in plan
 *   none blank a raked position, taken exactly as given
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE LENGTH SURVIVES THE TURN. Clearing X2 on a pipe that already runs
 * across would otherwise leave no extent in either direction — a 33-foot
 * electric would silently become a point. `previous` carries the run it had, so
 * blanking an axis TURNS the pipe rather than erasing it. Without this the
 * gesture the hint promises does the opposite of what it says.
