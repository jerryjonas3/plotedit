 *  The demo ships seven positions, one of them called "Electric 7". Delete any
 *  position and press add: six positions, so the new one is named "Electric 7"
 *  and the plot now has two. Every unit on that name then belongs to both —
 *  see `duplicateNames`.
 *
 *  ⚠ Counts from the number of positions, not from 1, so a plot with eight
 *  pipes offers "Electric 9" rather than walking up from the bottom every time.
