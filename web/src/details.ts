/**
 * Show & Venue — the fields that identify a plot, and the room it is drawn in.
 *
 * ⭐ Jerry, 2026.09.24: "do we need a section on the UI to enter the venue and
 * show information." Yes, and the answer got sharper the same day: the renderer
 * stopped hardcoding "Twin Oaks Studios" and "Design: Jerry Jonas", so the
 * title block now prints whatever the FILE says. Before this panel the only way
 * to put a name on a drawing — or to keep the wrong one off it — was to open
 * the .plot.json in a text editor.
 *
 * ⚠ Two kinds of field, and the difference matters:
 *
 *   IDENTITY   show, venue, designer, studio, revision. These print, and
 *              nothing else changes. A redraw is enough.
 *   THE ROOM   width, depth, grid height, house ceiling, plaster line. Every
 *              one of these moves the drawing or changes what is CHECKED — the
 *              grid height is what trims are judged against, the plaster line
 *              decides which positions are front of house. These have to
 *              recompute, not just redraw.
