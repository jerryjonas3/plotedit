 * (a, c) = (−1, 0), plotted at (c, a) = (0, −1). Negating the angle therefore
 * agrees with symbols.draw() at 0° and 180° — where sin is zero — and MIRRORS
 * it at ±90°:
 *
 *      pan    paper      screen, with -pan
 *        0   (0, −1)     (0, −1)   same

 *      270   (−1, 0)     (+1, 0)   OPPOSITE
 *
 * ⚠ It survived because nothing drawn in plan had ever aimed sideways. Every
 * unit in the sample aims up or downstage, and boom units — which do aim across
 * — stopped being drawn in plan when they moved to the §6.12 elevations. The
 * first pipe running up and downstage put five units at pan ±90 and the error
