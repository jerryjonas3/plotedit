"""Hanging positions: which way they run, and which end unit 1 is at.

⭐ UNIT NUMBERS FOLLOW RP-2 §2.3.2, which is explicit:

    "Luminaires on hanging positions perpendicular to centerline (e.g., battens)
     are numbered from STAGE LEFT TO STAGE RIGHT."
    "Luminaires on onstage booms or other vertical hanging positions are numbered
     from top to bottom, downstage to upstage."
    "Luminaires mounted on FOH positions parallel to centerline should number
     starting with the units nearest to plaster line."
    "Luminaires mounted on FOH positions non-parallel to centerline (box booms)
     should number starting with the units closest to centerline."

⚠ CHANNELS ARE A DIFFERENT THING and are NOT covered by the standard. RP-2
requires the channel to be shown on the plot and says outright that channel
hookups are "not addressed in this document." Jerry's channel convention —
**house left to house right**, so channel 1 is at stage right — is his own and
does not conflict with anything. See `channel_order()`.

**Unit numbers and channel numbers therefore run in OPPOSITE directions across a
batten**, which is correct and is not a bug: the unit number is for whoever hangs
the rig, the channel is for whoever sits in the house and reads the plot.

Coordinates, since the rules are expressed in them:

    x increases toward STAGE RIGHT.   y increases UPSTAGE.
    The origin is the downstage-LEFT corner of the room.

So stage left is the MINIMUM x, stage right the maximum, and downstage the
minimum y. Fixed in web/src/geometry.ts and corroborated by the sample plot,
where "Special SR" sits at x=22 and "Special SL" at x=11 in a 33-foot room.
