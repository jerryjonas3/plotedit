"""Turn the names in real paperwork into keys in the photometric table.

Lightwright and Vectorworks carry names like `ETC Source4 36deg`,
`ETC CE Source4 PAR MCM (MFL)`, `S4-26° LED-ClrSrc`. `photometrics.FIXTURES` is
keyed `S4 36`, `S4 EA PAR MFL`, `Lustr 26 EDLT`. **None of the 38 distinct names
in Jerry's archive matched.** A plot imported from Lightwright drew correctly and
was silently unlit — every throw computed, every pool and footcandle blank.

Three layers, in order:

  1. NORMALISE   strip the manufacturer, unify Source4/S4/Source 4, deg/°,
                 repair mojibake, collapse punctuation. Catches most of it.
  2. ALIASES     explicit, for what normalising cannot reach.
  3. NO_DATA     names that ARE real fixtures but have no photometrics on file.
                 These must resolve to a REASON, never to silence — "we have no
                 figures for an Altman 6" Fresnel" is useful; a blank cell is not.

# Names in the paperwork that are WRONG, and what the fixture actually was.

# of writing the same fixture" — a spelling. A correction says "the paperwork is
# mistaken" — a claim about the world. The second kind should be easy to find,
# easy to question and easy to reverse, so it does not get buried among the
# spellings and quietly outlive the reason for it.
#
# ⚠ Why a paperwork name can lose to a memory. In Lightwright the LOAD comes
# from the library entry for whatever fixture name was typed. So a row reading
# "Altman Spectra CYC 50 / 50w" is not the unit corroborating its own name — it
# is the library repeating the name back. The name and the wattage are ONE fact,
# not two, and one fact from 2022 does not outweigh the designer who hung them.
