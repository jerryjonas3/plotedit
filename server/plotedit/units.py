"""Feet or metres, and the one place that knows the difference.

⭐ Jerry, 2026.09.25, after a designer in the UK asked whether it would "cross
the pond": work out what metric needs.

⭐ THE PHYSICS IS ALREADY METRIC. Illuminance is candela ÷ distance², so the
same published candela gives FOOTCANDLES when the distance is in feet and LUX
when it is in metres. Same table, same formula, same gel percentages, same beam
angles. Nothing in photometrics.py needs re-sourcing — this module only changes
what a number is CALLED and how it is written down.

⚠ FEET STAY THE STORED UNIT. Every saved plot, every test fixture and the whole
RP-2 symbol geometry are in feet, and a Source Four is 22 inches long in
Birmingham too. Converting at the edges is also what the DXF importer already
does — it takes mm, cm or m and stores feet. One canonical unit, conversion only
where a human reads or types.

🔴 THE DANGER IS DOUBLE CONVERSION, and it is silent: a length converted twice
is out by a factor of 10.76 and still looks like a plausible room. Every
function here converts exactly once, at a boundary, and the round-trip tests
exist to pin that down.
