"""Instrument symbols drawn to USITT RP-2 (2006).

The standard is in docs/reference/USITT-RP-2-2006.pdf; the plates are pages 4–9,
and docs/SYMBOLS.md maps each fixture family to its section. **Read those before
changing anything here.** The previous symbols were drawn from memory and were
wrong in most respects; these are traced from the plates.

COORDINATES. Every symbol is defined in a local frame:

    +a  is toward the BACK of the instrument (the reflector end)
    -a  is toward the FRONT (the lens, where the light goes)
    +c / -c are the two sides
    the ORIGIN is the yoke — the hanging point, which is where RP-2 §2.2 says
    the symbol must be positioned

Sizes are in FEET and approximate the real instrument, per §2.2: "luminaire
symbols ... should represent the approximate size and shape of the luminaires in
scale." A Source Four is about 22" long and 7" across the body.

Each builder returns a list of (kind, payload) primitives so the same definition
can be drawn to PDF, to SVG, or to DXF without three copies of the geometry:

    ("poly",  [(a, c), ...], closed)      an outline
    ("line",  (a1, c1), (a2, c2))         a single stroke
    ("circle", (a, c), r, filled)
    ("text",  (a, c), "T", size)          a letter inside the symbol

# The Source Four family. RP-2 codes the beam angle by the MARK INSIDE THE LENS
# HOUSING, not by the length of the barrel:
#
#   70°        stepped rings at the front
#   50°        a wedge pointing back into the body
#   36°–40°    no mark
#   26°–30°    one diagonal
#   19°–20°    an X
#
# Only the very narrow units (15°, 10°, 5°) get a longer body, and those are a
# different sub-family in §6.1.6.

        0.34 - 1.00 L   the body, at full width, tapered at the back

    The flare is short and steep in RP-2, not a long gentle cone. Getting that
    wrong is what made the second attempt read as a funnel rather than an ERS.

    The front face is a touch TALLER than the body — that flare is what makes an
    ERS read as an ERS, and getting it backwards was the first attempt's worst error.

    ⚠ RP-2 draws the symbol at about 2:1; a real Source Four is nearer 2.7:1.
    §2.2 asks for approximate real size and shape, so the REAL footprint is used

    and the plot does not under-state how much pipe a unit occupies.

    # page put the second and third containers back through the instrument on
    # anything aimed downstage, where behind is +y.
