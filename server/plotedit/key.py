"""The legend / instrument key — RP-2 §5.

    §5.0: "Placement is acceptable in any location that does not conflict with
    other information."

⭐ A key is not a parts list. It is the drawing's own dictionary: it says what
each shape means, so a stranger can read the plot without asking the designer.
That is why §5.1 asks for the SYMBOLS themselves and not just names, and why
they are drawn at the plot's own scale here — a key drawn at a different size
teaches the reader a shape they will not see again.

§5.1 wants, and this produces:
  · symbols of every luminaire and device on the plot, with descriptions
  · beam spread where the name does not already carry it
  · every notation used, explained
  · colour manufacturer designations (R = Rosco, L = Lee, G = Gam …)
  · template manufacturer designation, when there is one
  · wattage and/or ANSI lamp code
  · symbols for any accessories

⚠ It reports what is ON THE PLOT, never the whole fixture table. A key listing
instruments nobody hung is a key nobody finishes reading.
