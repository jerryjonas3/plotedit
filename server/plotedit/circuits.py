"""Circuits on a hanging position.

⭐ THE CONSTRAINT, in Jerry's words (2026.09.23):

    "Circuits depend on the house — no set order."

**So this module never invents a circuit number, and never infers one from
position.** Unit numbers follow a rule and can be generated; circuits do not and
cannot. A house wired its pipes years ago in whatever order made sense to the
electrician who did it, and the only source of truth is that house: its rep
plot, its circuit map, or its master electrician standing under the pipe.

What this module does instead is **record what the house says and check the plot
against it.** A circuit that came from a guess is worse than a blank cell,
because a blank cell gets asked about at the site visit and a guess does not.

`circuits` on a position is therefore an INVENTORY, in the order the house has
them along the pipe if that is known. Each entry may carry a location; where the
locations are known a unit can be matched to the nearest one, and where they are
not, matching REFUSES rather than pairing them off in order — pairing in order
is exactly the guess this file exists to prevent.
