"""Where a position's NAME goes, so it does not land on something else.

⭐ RP-2 §2.1 wants every hanging position identified; it does not say where the
name goes, because on a drawing that is a fitting problem, not a standard. The
name went at the pipe's stage-left end, always, and on the Bluver plot that put
`CAT 1  (FOH)` and `HOUSE LEFT BOX BOOM 1` on top of each other and both across
the box boom's symbol — three pieces of ink in one place, and the one an
electrician needs first is the one underneath.

⚠ THE RULE LIVES HERE ONCE. The paper places labels through plot_to_pdf; the
browser asks POST /labels. The two must choose the same slot or the same plot
reads differently on screen and on paper — which has happened three times in a
week with other marks.

⚠ Text WIDTH is each side's own business. ReportLab measures Helvetica and the
browser measures whatever the system gives it, so the caller supplies the box
and this module only chooses between candidate slots. The decision is shared;
the metrics cannot be.
