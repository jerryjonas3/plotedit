The cue exporter in eos_ascii.py was reverse-engineered from a real Eos export
after three guesses at the format failed — the lesson being that a real file out
of the target application settles in minutes what documentation does not. No
real Eos *patch* export was available when this was written, so the layout below
follows the USITT spec and nothing more. **Import it into a scratch show file
before relying on it**, and if it is wrong, export a patch from Eos and diff.
