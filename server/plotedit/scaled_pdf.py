scaled_pdf.py — draw theatre paperwork to architectural scale, as PDF.

Amy's drawing tool. ReportLab writes in PostScript points (72 pt = 1 inch
exactly), so a drawing made here measures true on paper — provided it is
printed at 100% / "Actual size", never "Fit to page".

Real-world input is FEET. Convert with ft(feet, inches=0).

    from plotedit.scaled_pdf import Sheet, ft
    s = Sheet("plan.pdf", page="ARCH_D", scale="1/4", landscape=True,
              show="Without Consent", venue="Louis Bluver Theatre at the Drake",
              sheet="Light Plot — plan", rev="A")

    s.finish()                                # adds scale bar, 1-inch check, title block

Scales: "1/8", "1/4", "3/8", "1/2", "3/4", "1" (inches on paper per foot),
or any float (paper inches per real foot). Pages: LETTER, LEGAL, TABLOID
(11x17), ARCH_A..ARCH_E, A4, A3. Custom: page=(w_in, h_in).

DXF: pass dxf="plan.dxf" to also write the geometry in feet, layered. Read a
venue's drawing under the plot with s.import_dxf(path, layers=[...], units="in").
Run dxf_bridge.dxf_info(path) first to see its units and layers.

Verify a PDF you did not make here: measure the scale bar with any PDF
reader's measuring tool, or run  scaled_pdf.py --check file.pdf  which
reads the 1-inch check bar and reports its width in points (want 72.0).

        **A catwalk is not a pipe.** It has a real width, a person stands on it,
        and the instruments hang off its downstage rail rather than its middle —
        so a unit drawn on the centre of a catwalk is drawn three feet from where
        it actually is. At 1/2" scale that is an eighth of an inch on paper and a
        missed shutter cut in the room.

        it sits OVER THE AUDIENCE — downstage of the plaster line, outside the

        bite:

          * **The sheet has to reach the house.** A plot whose room is the stage
            will clip a catwalk straight off, and the clipping guard is the only
            thing that would say so. `foh_extent()` returns how far downstage the
            positions actually go, so the drawing can be sized to include them.
          * **The throw is long and the angle is steep.** Nothing here needs to
            change for that — the photometrics already work from real geometry —
            but a catwalk unit reading a much lower footcandle than an onstage
            one is correct, not a bug.
