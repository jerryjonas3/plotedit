"""Where plots live on disk, and the only code allowed to write there.

⭐ Jerry, 2026.09.24: "the save is not automatically overwriting the file — it
tries a new name Without Consent.plot (1).json." That suffix is the browser's
DOWNLOAD behaviour. Save was written on the File System Access API, which can
overwrite a file in place — but only Chrome and Edge have it, so on Safari and
Firefox every press landed another copy in Downloads and the newest plot was
whichever had the longest number in brackets.

⚠ ONE code path, not two. A browser-API save and a server save would behave
differently on different machines, which is the divergence that has cost a day
already elsewhere in this repo. This is a tool with its own local server; the
server can write the file, so it always does.

🔴 THE NAME IS A NAME, NEVER A PATH. Everything written goes in the plots
directory and nowhere else: no separators, no "..", no absolute paths, no
symlinks followed out. The service binds to localhost and the person driving it
owns the machine, but "the user is trusted" is not a reason to accept
../../.ssh/authorized_keys from a web page.
