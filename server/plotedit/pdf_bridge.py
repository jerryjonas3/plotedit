"""A venue's ground plan out of a PDF, as polylines in feet.

⭐ Jerry, 2026.09.24: "could we do the same for PDFs too?" Venues send PDFs far
more often than they send DXFs — a PDF is what comes back when you ask a house
for its plan, because it is what their drawing office exports for everybody.

⚠ A PDF HAS NO UNITS, only paper. Its coordinates are points, 72 to the printed
inch, so the only way to reach feet is the drawing's SCALE — the "1/4\" = 1'-0\""
printed in its title block. That figure has to come from the reader; nothing in
the file states it in a form anything can read. Get it wrong by a factor of two
and the plan is still a perfectly plausible drawing of a different room, which
is why the importer reports the size it arrived at and says to check it.

⚠ AND NO LAYERS. A DXF import can take WALLS and leave the dimensions and the
title block behind; a PDF is one flat pile of strokes, so the border, the
title block and every dimension line come in with the walls. That is a real
difference in what the two formats can give you, and saying so is better than
importing half of it by a guess about what looks structural.
