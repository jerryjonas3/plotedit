"""The IES parser, against Altman's real Spectra Cyc 100 measurement.

    cd server && python3 test_ies.py

Altman publish no photometric numbers in any datasheet for the Spectra Cyc range,
but they do publish IES files for the 100 and 200. This is how those become
usable — and the datasheet corroborates the parse exactly.
