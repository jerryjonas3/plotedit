"""The section is reachable without a terminal, and it is worth reaching.

    cd server && python3 test_section.py

#92. `plot_to_section.py` has drawn a correct RP-2 §3 section since the scaffold
commit and shipped in every download. The only way to get one was:

    cd server && python3 plot_to_section.py yourplot.plot.json ../out/section.pdf

🔴 For an application whose whole premise is that it needs Python and nothing
else — double-click `run.command` and draw — that is not shipped. A beta tester
went looking for a section in the Export menu the day before this was written,
after being told one existed, and found nothing.

⭐ AND LOOKING AT THE OUTPUT FOUND A SECOND BUG, which is the half of this that
matters. A beam edge is projected to the floor; the shallow-angle guard only
skipped edges under 0.02 rad (1.1°), so a 2° edge from a 14-foot trim ran out to
roughly 400 feet. One such line stretched the drawing's extent to 93 feet for a
38-foot room, `fit` dropped a scale step to accommodate it, and the section came
out at 1/4" using 17% of an ARCH D sheet. Clipped to the room, the same plot
draws at 1/2".
