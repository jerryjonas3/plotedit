"""Step 7: line weights, and the rulers along the edges of the plan.

    cd server && python3 test_drafting.py

⭐ WHY. RP-2 gives three line weights and the module picks the points for them:
heavy was 1.7pt, which is correct by the standard and reads as a heavy plot.
"The lines are too thick for pipes" was the report, and it was right.

⚠ THE TRAP THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. A width override is only worth having if it
reaches EVERYTHING drawn at that weight. The first version changed the pipes and
left the instruments at full weight, because symbols.draw() read the module
constant instead of asking the sheet — the one place the mismatch is most
visible. Several assertions below exist only to catch that coming back.
