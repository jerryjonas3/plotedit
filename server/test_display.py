⭐ WHAT THIS IS FOR. The `pools`, `focus` and `labels` checkboxes changed the
screen and nothing else: Export gave back everything regardless, so the only way
to issue a clean plan was to delete the focus points and put them back after.

It also covers the rest of what the sheet SAYS: a note that reaches the paper
whole, and a number where a number belongs.

⚠ AND THE RULE THAT MATTERS MORE. A switch that hides a DRAWING must never hide
a FINDING. Turning the pools off used to take the "this pool never lands"
warning away with the ellipse, because the shape was only worked out inside the
branch that drew it — so a plot came out clean by showing less. Every assertion
below about warnings and rows exists to keep that from coming back.
