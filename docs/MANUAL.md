# plotedit — the manual

How to draft a plot with it, field by field and button by button.

This is the **how**. [README.md](../README.md) is the **what and why** — what it
draws, what it refuses to do, and how to install it. Start there if you have not
run it yet.

## 1. Starting and stopping

Double-click **`run.command`** (Mac) or **`run.bat`** (Windows). Your browser
opens on the editor.

**That is how you start it every time.** There is no separate launcher and
nothing to install after the first run.

⚠ **Leave the terminal window open while you work.** Closing it — or ctrl-C in
it — stops the program. The browser tab will still be there, but nothing will
save.

To stop: close the terminal window.

---

## 2. The screen

**The drawing is on the left, the panels on the right.** Drag the bar between
them to change the split; it remembers where you put it. The bar is also
keyboard-operable — tab to it and use the arrow keys, or Enter to reset.

### The top row

| | |
|---|---|
| | |
|---|---|
| **↶ ↷** | Undo and redo. A whole drag is one step, not fifty. |
| **New** | Start over. Asks before discarding unsaved work, then asks what the show is called. |
| **Open… ▾** | Opens a menu of the plots in your plots folder, with what shipped with plotedit in its own group below, and **Change folder…** at the foot. |
| **Save** / **Save As…** | ⌘S and ⇧⌘S. **Save greys out when there is nothing to save**; Save As… does not, because saving a copy under a new name is a real thing to want. |
| **Revert** | Reloads the plot from disk, dropping every change since. Asks first, and **can be undone with ⌘Z**. Greyed out when nothing has changed. |
| **Export… ▾** | A menu of everything it can produce, and the three settings that only affect the printed PDF. See [§10](#10-exports). |
| **Ground plan…** | Imports the venue — **DXF or PDF**. This never draws architecture itself; the room arrives as a drawing somebody else made. |

⭐ **Sheet and Scale are inside Export now.** They change the exported PDF and
nothing else — the screen has never looked at either — so they live with the
thing they affect. **The second row says what you would get**, at the right:
`ARCH D · Fit`. Click it to change them.

### The layers

One connected group, because they are one job: each shows or hides a layer of the
drawing. A filled chip is on. They are listed in **drawing order**, from the
bottom of the drawing to the top.

| | |
|---|---|
| **plan** | The imported ground plan under everything. |
| **pools** | The light on the floor. See [§7](#7-pools). |
| **positions** | The pipes, booms and their mounts. |
| **focus** | The dashed leader from each unit to what it is pointed at. |
| **units** | The instrument symbols. ⭐ Switch it off to read the pipes alone. |
| **labels** | Unit numbers, channels, colour, purpose, and the position names. |

⭐ **The layers are saved with the plot.** Reopen it tomorrow and it is as you
left it — which also means that switching one off marks the plot unsaved, and
that an accidental toggle is one **undo** away.

⚠ **Text needs the thing it names.** A position's name is on **labels**, but it
only prints when **positions** is on as well; a unit's channel and colour need
**units**. A label floating where its pipe or its symbol has been hidden names
something that is not on the drawing.

⚠ **Pools and focus are not tied to units.** Where a light lands is worth seeing
with the symbols off, so switching **units** off leaves the pools where they are.

**at …** sits beside the group and belongs to **pools** — it is the height the
pools are cut at, not a layer. ⚠ With pools off it goes grey, because there is
nothing for it to say.

### Two more layers that only print

**dimensions** and **notes** are carried in the plot with the six above, but they
have no chip, because there is nothing on screen for a chip to change — the
rulers and the key exist only in the exported PDF. **dimensions** is the
**Rulers** tick in the Export menu, and it starts off; **notes** is the key
block, and it starts on.

### Zoom

The slider runs **2 to 40 pixels per foot**. The three buttons fit the whole
plot, the height, or the width. **100%** returns to 14 px per foot.

### The panels

**Show & Venue**, **Instrument**, **Positions**, **Schedule** — each collapses,
and the number on the right tells you how many of a thing there are.

⭐ **Show & Venue starts closed**, because it is the panel you fill in once. Press
**New** and it opens itself, since a new plot has nothing else to do first.

⚠ **Whichever panels you leave open is remembered**, so after the first time this
is yours rather than ours.

---

## 3. A plot from nothing

### Say where you are

Open **Show & Venue** and fill in the show, venue, designer, revision and date.
These go in the title block. ⭐ **The date printed is the plot's own**, so a
reprint of an old plot still carries the date it was issued; leave it blank and
the sheet prints the day you export.

Then **The Room**: width, depth, grid height, house ceiling, plaster line.

⚠ **Blank means "not known", and it is a real answer.** The checks say so out
loud rather than assuming zero — a grid height of 0 would be a claim that the
ceiling is on the floor.

**Units** — imperial or metric — changes every length in the app *and* the scales
offered for print.

**Control** is how the house gets power to a lamp, and it changes the notation
rather than just the data:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Dimmer per circuit** | Most houses. The circuit is hard-wired to its own dimmer, so the two are **one number** and the plot draws one hexagon. Drawing two containers here is not harmlessly tidy — it tells the electrician there is a patch to make, and there is not. |
| **Hard and soft patch** | Circuit, dimmer and channel all differ. All three containers. |
| **No soft patch** | The console addresses dimmers directly. |
| **Dimmer = address (ETC)** | A dimmer is one DMX address carrying intensity, so the dimmer number *is* the address. The hexagon carries the address, exactly as it does for an LED, and a mixed rig reads the same throughout. |

**Beam angle** is how every ellipsoidal on the plot shows its angle — one setting
for the whole plot, as the 2025 USITT RP allows either:

| | |
|---|---|
| **A mark in the lens (RP)** | The default. An X for 19–20°, a diagonal for 26–30°, nothing for 36–40°, a wedge for 50°, three short lines for 14°. |
| **The number in the barrel** | The angle written where the mark would go. Plainer on a rig where every unit shares one body — a 40° and a 10° both carry no mark, and at plot size they are hard to tell apart. A zoom keeps its Z. |

### Bring in the ground plan

**Ground plan…** → pick a **DXF** or **PDF** of the venue.

A **PDF** takes two more answers, because a PDF does not record either:

- **Which page**, if more than one has a drawing on it. It lists them with their
  sheet size and how many lines each holds. ⚠ A **scanned** plan has no vectors
  at all, and it says so rather than importing nothing and looking broken.
- **What scale that drawing is.** It is printed in the title block.

It then tells you how big the imported drawing came out:

```
1,284 paths at 1/4" = 1'-0" — 61.0' x 44.0' including the sheet border.
Check that against something you measured.
```

🔴 **Check it.** At the wrong scale the import is still a perfectly believable
drawing — just of a different building. That number is the only thing that
catches it.

### Build the positions

**Positions** → **+ Add position**. Each one has a name, a type —
electric, pipe, grid, catwalk, truss, boom, box-boom, ladder, tormentor — a trim,
and its ends.

It **asks you what to call it**, and suggests a name nobody is using.

⭐ **Draw the pipe instead of typing it.** Press **draw**, click one end on the
plan, then the other. Six boxes describe a pipe exactly and none of them is how
anybody thinks about one. Escape stops.

⚠ **There is no draw button on a vertical position** — a boom, box boom, ladder
or tormentor. It is a single point in plan, so there are no two ends to point at.
Type its x and y.

A **vertical** position (boom, box boom, ladder, tormentor) is a *point* in plan:
every unit on it shares one x and y and is told apart by height. It also asks for
a **Mount**: boom base, floor plate or flange.

⭐ **Two positions may share a name, on purpose.** A V or an L is one position
made of two straight segments — say so by giving both the same name. The app
tells you what that means rather than stopping you: they become one heading in
the schedule and the hookup, and one run of unit numbers.

🔴 **Then the unit numbers have to be unique across both legs.** RP-2 numbers
units per position, so unit 1 on two separate pipes is correct — but a shared name
makes those pipes one position, and no piece of paperwork can tell two unit 1s
apart. **+ unit** keeps them unique as you go. Merging two pipes that each had
1-5 does not, and the position says so in red when it happens.

⭐ **Record the house's circuits on the position** if you know them. The app never
invents circuit numbers — they depend on the house and have no set order — but it
will check your plot against what you entered and tell you when a unit is on a
circuit that position does not have.

### Hang units

On a position, **+ unit**. **delete** removes the position.

Then drag them where they go. A unit **snaps to the nearest pipe** as you drag;
**hold Alt** to place one deliberately off a pipe.

### Numbering them

Two ways, and they are for different plots.

**renumber** orders the whole run by geometry — stage left to stage right on a
batten, top down then downstage to upstage on a boom, nearest the plaster line out
front (RP-2 §2.3.2). One press, and it shows you every move before it changes
anything.

**number by clicking** asks where to start, then you click the units in the order
they hang. What you click is what you get. Use it where no single rule can put the
units in order — **a V, an L, a curved cove**, or a rig somebody else hung. The
status line says what each click replaced, **⌘Z** undoes one click, and Escape
stops and tells you what it left behind.

⚠ **Neither is a tidy-up to run without thinking.** A unit number is spiked on the
pipe, written in the hookup the electrician is holding, and called out in the
dark. Renumbering rewrites every one of them in the file and none of them in the
room. **If one number is wrong, change that one by hand.**

### Point them

Drag the **ring** — the focus handle — to where the light lands. The dashed
leader follows.

Or type it: **Focus X**, **Focus Y**, and **Focus height** (head height, 5'-6",
unless the light lands somewhere else).

### Colour and patch

See [§4](#4-the-instrument-panel).

---

## 4. The instrument panel

Click a unit — on the drawing or in the schedule — and the panel fills. The
fields are in the order you use them, not the order a database would put them.

| Field | |
|---|---|
| **Unit** | Its number on the pipe. |
| **Channel** | What the console calls it. |
| **Purpose** | What it is *for*. Right under the channel because that is what you read next. |
| **Circuit** | The **house** circuit. Never generated. |
| **Dimmer** | |
| **Address** | `45`, or `2/21` for a universe. The **start** address; the schedule prints the range. |
| **Model** | The specific fixture. Personalities differ between models, so the address range depends on this. |
| **DMX personality** | What the fixture is set to at its own display. Two identical units can be on different personalities. |
| **Type** | The fixture. ⭐ **The lens is part of the type** — a `Lustr 26 EDLT` and a `Lustr 36 EDLT` are different rows, which is why changing it resizes the pool. There is no separate beam-angle box to contradict it. |
| **Position** | |
| **Color** | A dropdown of **498 gels** — Roscolux and LEE — that you can also type into. `R52+R119` **stacks** (the transmissions multiply); `R52/R119` is a **split frame** (only the first counts). Neither is in any list, which is why this is not a plain dropdown. ⚠ A bare number is refused: `R119` is Light Hamburg Frost at 89% and `L119` is Dark Blue at 2%. |
| **Gobo** | |
| **Accessories** | Separate with `+` — "top hat + gobo". Gate accessories are drawn at the gate, front accessories at the nose; you say only what is on the unit. |
| **X / Y / Trim** | ⭐ Usually not typed — they arrive from dragging. The boxes are there to read back and to correct. On a **boom**, trim is the height on the boom and is written to both fields. |
| **Focus X / Y / height** | |
| **Lamp** | What is in it. A **Source 4WRD** retrofit is a lamp: same barrel, same lens, 150 W instead of 575. |
| **LED mode** | The **photometric** output mode — how bright. Not the DMX personality. |
| **Lens angle** | Oval-beam units only (PARNel): degrees the lens is turned. |
| **Notes** | |

**Delete instrument** is at the bottom, and it asks first.

---

## 5. Greyed-out fields

**A greyed field is a fact about the rig, not a fault.** Hover it and it says
why. It keeps its value; it just stops taking input.

| Field | Greyed when |
|---|---|
| **Lamp** | the fixture is an LED engine — there is no lamp in it |
| **LED mode** | it is not — it takes a lamp |
| **Dimmer** | the unit is patched as `Dimmer`, or the house is dimmer-is-address and it has an address |
| **Lens angle** | it is not an oval-beam unit |
| **Model** | no specific models are on file for that type |
| **DMX personality** | no personalities are published for it |

⚠ **A greyed field still shows what is in it.** If a Lustr somehow carries an
HPL 575, you will see it, greyed, with the reason. Hiding a wrong value is how it
survives to the load-in.

---

## 6. The numbers at the top

Above the fields, for the selected unit:

```
14'-8" throw · 35° · pool 6'-6"
147 fc   at HPL 575 (MF 0.78), through R52 26% + R119 89%
```

- **Throw** — unit to focus point, in three dimensions.
- **The angle** — how steep it is.
- **Pool** — the **field** across, at the plane you chose.
- **The level**, and **what it was computed from**. Note that it names the lamp
  multiplier *and* both gels with their transmissions, so you can check it.

On a metric plot that reads `4.5 m`, `38°` and `lx` — the unit follows the plot,
never a hardcoded "fc".

### When it cannot give you a level

The geometry still comes out; the level says why it did not:

```
18'-1" throw · 40° · pool 21'-4"
no candela on file for S4 90 — ETC Source Four 90° datasheet (angles);
candela not extracted
```

### When it cannot compute at all

```
Not computed — needs a focus point
```

It names only what is missing: **a trim height**, **a focus point**, or both.

⭐ **Both of those are the app working, not failing.** A number it cannot justify
is a number it will not print.

---

## 7. Pools

**Ellipses, not circles.** A cone only cuts a circle when it points straight
down. At 30° a 26° field lands more than twice as long as it is wide, and the
long end is the one that reaches the scenery.

The **at …** menu cuts them at head height (5'-6"), a face (5'-2"), seated
(3'-6"), or the deck. Different planes are different plots: what covers a face
does not cover a floor.

---

## 8. Mouse and keyboard

### Mouse

| | |
|---|---|
| Click a unit | select it |
| Drag the **body** | move it — snaps to the nearest pipe |
| **Alt**-drag | move it without snapping |
| Drag the **ring** | re-aim it |
| **Shift**-drag the **body** | re-aim it — for a unit focused straight down, whose ring is hidden under it |
| A unit in a **boom elevation** | selects, but does not drag — the elevation is a diagram beside the plot, and its height is compressed |

### Keyboard

| | |
|---|---|
| **⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z** | undo / redo |
| **⌘S / ⇧⌘S** | Save / Save As… |
| **Arrows** | nudge by an **inch** |
| **Shift + arrows** | nudge by a **foot** |
| **Escape** | deselect — and stop drawing a pipe, numbering a run, or calibrating |
| **Delete / Backspace** | delete the unit — **asks first** |

⭐ **Up the screen is upstage.**

### Typing measurements

Anywhere it shows a length it accepts one:

```
1'6"      1'-6"      1' 6"      18"      1.5
```

---

## 9. Saving, opening, and where files live

Plots go in a **`plots`** folder next to `run.command`, as `.plot.json`.

**Save** writes the file you are on. **Save As…** starts a new one. **Open…**
lists what is there.

**Save is greyed out when there is nothing to save**, and hovering it says so.
⌘S says the same rather than writing. **Save As… stays live** — saving a copy
under a new name is a real thing to want with nothing changed, and it is the only
way to write a plot you have never saved.

**Revert** reloads the plot from disk and drops every change since. It asks
first, and ⭐ **it can be undone** — one ⌘Z brings the work back, so it is safe to
press. ⚠ Saving moves the point it goes back to: Revert means *as the file is on
disk*, which is the same as *as you opened it* until the first save.

⭐ **To keep plots somewhere else, Open… → Change folder…** — your own folder
dialog opens and plotedit uses that folder for the rest of the session. For a
folder that persists, set `PLOTEDIT_PLOTS` before starting.

⭐ **The samples are at the bottom of Open…**, under *"Comes with plotedit"*. Each
opens as **a copy with no name**, so ⌘S asks where to put it rather than writing
back over the file that shipped. Pressing **New** does not lose them.

| | |
|---|---|
| **The Odd Couple — demo.plot.json** | The demo: a black box, eighteen units. What the app opens when there is nothing else. |
| **Rep — Sample Big House.plot.json** | A large proscenium house: 201 units on four electrics and a cyc electric, pro slots, ceiling catwalks and a balcony rail. Every unit is focused straight down as a stand-in. ⚠ It is big — at ¼" it needs ARCH E (36 × 48); on ARCH D, print it at ⅛". |

To keep them somewhere else — a show folder, or Dropbox — set `PLOTEDIT_PLOTS`
to that path before starting.

⭐ **A plot is plain JSON.** Readable in a text editor, diffable, and still
openable in twenty years without a subscription. That is deliberate.

**"Unsaved changes"** by the show name means exactly that. Selecting a unit is
not a change; nor is typing a value back the way it was. Undo your way back to
what is on disk and it clears.

---

## 10. Exports

**Export… ▾** opens a menu grouped by what each one produces: the two drawings,
then the two pieces of paperwork, then the console file. Below them, under
**PDF only**, sit the three settings that affect nothing else.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Sheet** | The paper the PDF is drawn on — LETTER through **ARCH E (36 × 48)** on an imperial plot, the A series on a metric one. ⚠ A sheet too small **refuses** rather than cropping, and names one that fits. |
| **Scale** | **Fit** picks the largest standard scale at which nothing runs off the chosen sheet. ⚠ The list is imperial fractions on an imperial plot and metric ratios on a metric one, never both — offering ¼" on a metric plot would let you issue a drawing at a ratio your scale rule does not have. |
| **Rulers** | A dimension scale along the edges of the plan. Print only; the screen never draws them. ⭐ This is the **dimensions** layer, so your choice is now saved with the plot rather than forgotten on reload. |

### ⭐ The exported PDF has layers in it

Open a plot PDF in any reader with a **Layers** panel — Acrobat, Preview's
sidebar, most others — and the eight layers are there with a checkbox each.
Switching one off removes it from the screen **and from the print**.

**This is for the ladder.** Switch everything off but **Positions** and
**Units** and you are holding the hang: pipes, symbols, and nothing else. No
pools, no focus leaders, no key, no imported ground plan.

⚠ **The title block, the scale bar and the one-inch check are not a layer** and
cannot be switched off. A sheet that can be stripped of what it is and what
scale it was drawn at is not a drawing anybody should be working from.

⚠ **A layer you hid before exporting is not in the PDF at all**, so it has no
checkbox either — what you did not print cannot be switched back on by the
reader. Hiding is a property of the drawing; the schedule and the hookup always
report the whole rig.

### The section

**Export → Section.** The drawing trims are read off: the deck, the grid, head
height, and one luminaire per position drawn to scale.

⭐ **One luminaire per position, not all of them.** RP-2 §3 asks for "the luminaire
that determines batten height" — the governing one. Drawing all sixty turns a
section into a smear and hides the only thing it is for.

⚠ **It cuts on centreline, and the title block says so.** A section needs a cut
line and the plot does not carry one. Rather than ask before anything can be
drawn, it takes the obvious cut and states it — §3 requires the cut to be defined
on the sheet in any case.

🔴 **It prints what it has NOT been given**, in a block on the drawing:

| missing | until you have it |
|---|---|
| **Audience sight point** — the worst seat's row and eye height | no vertical sightline is drawn |
| **Masking** — borders, legs, teasers | your trims are **not proven to clear**; a pipe may hang into a border |
| **Scenery** | no obstruction is checked; a beam may be blocked |

**That is a site-visit list, not a nag.** The sheet says plainly that it shows the
room and the rig and **is not a clearance check** — because a section that quietly
left those out would look finished and would not be.

⚠ **A plot with no trims gets no section**, and says so rather than handing you a
drawing of an empty room.

⭐ **Sheet and Scale are not independent, and sitting together is how you see it.**
Fit means *the largest scale at which nothing runs off the chosen sheet* — so
changing the sheet can change the scale. The readout at the right of the second
row always says where they stand.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Plot PDF** | The drawing, at the sheet and scale above. |
| **Section** | The lighting section, to RP-2 §3. See below. |
| **Plot DXF** | For anyone who needs it in CAD. |
| **Instrument schedule** | Position, Unit, Channel, Circuit, Dimmer, Address, Thru, Type, Wattage, Color, Gobo, Purpose, Accessory, Notes. |
| **Channel hookup** | The same rig in channel order. |
| **Eos patch** | ⚠ **Untested against a console.** Written to the USITT ASCII spec and nothing more. Treat it as a draft. |

⚠ **Exports refuse rather than clip.** If a drawing will not fit the sheet, a
dialog says by how much, names the largest scale that fits, and names a sheet
that holds it at the scale you chose — instead of quietly cropping it. Change
**Sheet** or **Scale** and export again.

**Line weights** follow the 2025 USITT RP: the instruments are the thickest line,
the pipes medium, and the building gray, so the plot reads as the rig first and
the room second. The three weights can still be changed under **Show & Venue →
Line weights**, in points on paper.

---

## 11. When it will not answer

The app says "I do not know" a lot, on purpose. **A figure on paperwork looks
exactly as authoritative whether it is right or wrong**, and the unit patched
into the tail of a wrong address range is the one nobody finds until tech.

So it will tell you, rather than guess:

- **A gel it does not have.** Diffusions especially — neither Rosco nor LEE
  publish transmissions for them on the web.
- **A fixture with no published candela.** Cyc units mostly. It still draws them
  and still gives you the paperwork.
- **A DMX footprint for a personality nobody documented.** It shows the start
  address and says why there is no range.
- **A circuit the house does not list** on that position, if you told it what the
  house has.

⚠ **It does not check clearance.** It draws the room and the rig. Masking,
scenery and rigging points are not in it, so a trim it accepts may still hang
into a border.

---

## 12. When something goes wrong

**It will not start.** The terminal window stays open on an error and says why.
On Windows, the usual cause is the Microsoft Store Python stub — install from
[python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and tick *"Add python.exe to
PATH"*. On a Mac the first run may need right-click → **Open** → **Open**.

**A fixture draws as a plain ring.** It is a type the app does not know. It will
still take all the paperwork; it just has no symbol. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) — mapping an unknown name onto an existing
RP-2 family is one line and needs no drawing.

**A number looks wrong.** Hover it. Everything computed says what it came from.

**Reporting something.** The build number is in the top bar, by the show name.
Quote it.
